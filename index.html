      <h2>The day we met</h2>

      <p>The day we met, I didn’t realise I was being slowly, carefully cooked .</p>

      <p>You were calm, composedish… almost <em>too</em> well-behaved .</p>

      <p>
        You carried yourself like someone who had it all together, soft-spoken, polite & intentional .
        The kind of girl who knows exactly how she wants to be seen .
        You posed without trying, choosing your words, holding back just enough to make me crave more of you .
        And I remember thinking, <em>okay… she’s different for the rest .</em>
      </p>

      <p>But there was something underneath that calm . A quiet confidence . A spark you weren’t letting loose just yet .</p>

      <p>
        It felt like the calm before a storm..... not a bad one, but the kind that changes the air .
        I didn’t know it then, but you were already pulling me in, not loudly, not forcefully… just steadily .
        And when I walked away from that first encounter, you stayed on my mind longer than I expected .
      </p>

      <p>That’s how it started . Soft . Controlled & Dangerously intentional .</p>

  <div class="popup-overlay hidden" id="popup-knew">
    <div class="popup-content">

      <h2>When I knew</h2>

      <p>The night you made that picnic in your room changed everything for me .</p>

      <p>It wasn’t about how it looked, though it was beautiful . It was about the thought behind it .</p>

      <p>You planned it . You imagined it . You cared enough to turn a normal space into something meaningful for me .</p>

      <p>
        Candles, effort, detail but more than that, <strong>intention</strong> .
        You didn’t do it to impress me . You did it to make me feel special . Seen . Considered .
      </p>

      <p>That night, it clicked .</p>

      <p>
        This wasn’t just attraction . This wasn’t just chemistry .
        This was someone who loves with effort and attentiveness .
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyone can say nice things . Anyone can show up when it’s convenient .
        But that night showed me how deeply you think and how naturally love flows from you .
      </p>

      <p><em>This is my person .</em></p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- Popup: Us now -->
  <div class="popup-overlay hidden" id="popup-now">
    <div class="popup-content">
      <span class="close-btn">&times;</span>
      <h2>Us now</h2>

      <p>Right now, we’re not pretending to be perfect .</p>

      <p>We’re real . We’ve grown . We’ve been tested .</p>

      <p>
        Loving you has made me more intentional, slower to anger, and more aware of how my actions affect
        someone I genuinely care about .
      </p>

      <p>
        You’ve taught me that love isn’t just about passion but it’s about patience .
        It’s about understanding . It’s about being present .
      </p>

      <p>
        We choose each other every single day not because it’s easy,
        but because it’s worth it .
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m growing because of you . I’m softer where I used to be guarded .
        And even knowing the storm behind the calm… I’d still choose you every time .
      </p>
